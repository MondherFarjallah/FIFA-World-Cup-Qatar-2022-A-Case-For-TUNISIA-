# FIFA-World-Cup-Qatar-2022-A-Case-For-TUNISIA-
So in this notebook I will try to explore the Qatar FIFA World Cup 2022 games dataset highlighting the key features/attributes of teams. In addition to the obvious stats that contributes to a team's success I will try to explore if there are hidden game attributes which can be important to success in an attempt to make a case for Tunisia

The dataset contains game statistics of all the teams competing at the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. Each row in the data represents a country and each column is a game statistics. This dataset has 32 rows and 189 columns
